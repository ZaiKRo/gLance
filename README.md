All your player information, in a glance.

## What exactly does it do?  
Stand usually does not show that cool pop-out with highlighted player info that other menus have. So, this Lua adds that in. Simply start the Lua and then highlight/"focus" someone in your players list and you will see a ton of info about them, all in a glance.  

## Install  
Drag everything into your Lua Scripts folder except the readme.md and LICENSE file. Done!  

## Usage  
Run the script in Lua Scripts / gLance.  
To activate mouse mode (ie to click the buttons), press B. To deactivate it, press B again.
