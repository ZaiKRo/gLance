### All your player information, in a glance.  
Glance adds the "popout-menu-when-player-highlighted" thing that Stand never had. As well as some aggressively detailed information. Plus some cool buttons. It's pretty awesome.

## Install  
Drag everything into your Lua Scripts folder except the readme.md and LICENSE file. Done!  

## Usage  
Run the script in Lua Scripts / gLance.  
To activate mouse mode (ie to click the buttons), press B. To deactivate it, press B again.
